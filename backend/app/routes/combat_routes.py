# TODO : Combat within range for now
#  Get users weapon, estimate range of damage on target,
#  allow front-end to calculate, verify within the a plausible range of values.
#  The point is to reduce load on the backend, and if there is a problem with cheating,
#  I will have the resources to find a better solution
